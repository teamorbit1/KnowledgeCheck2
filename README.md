I created a quick website using HTML, boostrap styling, and JS.

I created a responsive form, responsive images, and a nice navbar that reflects the same on all pages

I made the navbar collapse on all smaller screens

The entire webpage is fully responsive depending on screen size.

I used all the Boostrap and html knowledge I have learned in this class.
